      <h3>A poker Tell</h3>
        <p>How does anyone ended up playing poker for a living right ? From a lot of people's view it is hard to consider  playing poker a career and a source of income, they see it as a hobby. It is odd ...<br><br>

        But that's how it is started for me, twentysomeones getting around playing poker with coins! all night long. We did not know the rules so well, we were just gambling and having fun. But as time passed, that group of friends  started growing up, we were invitng friends of friends to join. The firsts tournaments for little money came along, but again, it was just for fun.<br><br>
        
        It was until then, that one member of the group began to take it more serious than just a fun activity to do until the sun raises in the morning, he staterd to learn basic strategy, playing many hours during the week on his computer and crushing us when playing live together. Of course we did not think he was going to make any money from this.... but he did!, it was not much at that time but it was a lot for us... we were twetysomething at that time.
        
        I dont remeber exactly, but maybe 2 or 3 yeras later, that friend, moved to buenos aires, Argentina, he was playing  poker proffesionaly and traveling to big tournaments around the world. The others members of the group were yet getting together some weekends and play for fun, we loved it!<br><br>
        
        Suddenly, a unexpected source of information came to us from our professional friend when he became a very close friend from one of the best players of the world at that time, it was a genious type of guy from Argentina who play heads up sit and go for an insane amount of money  versus the elite of poker from around the world and was very good at it.<br><br>
        
        One day this guy came to Uruguay for vacations and we had the fortune to meet him. He was not only a great player but also a kind and humble person. This I would say, was the inflection point, because we were introduce to a world of poker we had never seen before.  The complex startegy behing, the mental procces it requires, bankroll management, software support to study from and the game theoretical optimization. Almost instant, some of us formed a group and began to study and play poker more every day. We were hungry for knowledge and making aliving out of it..so we  talked and learned about poker everyday, all day!<br>
        
        Next year, while playing a new format that attracted tons of  rookie  players, I had the chance to make some money and began my journey....I move out form my parents house, drop college and never look back. Until today, it was one of the biggets and smartest decsiones I made in my life. From day one and until nowadays...6 years later, I still love playing poker. There were some really good ups and very bad downs but I always stay in the game. I can truely say I found one of my passions in life<br><br>
        
        So why someone who found a passion and has a high level in poker, who can also do it from the comfort  of his house, would ever make a career change into programming ? ...</p>

      <h3>..Connecting The Dots..</h3>
      <p>So.. to answer the question above I would like to begin saying that in a meeting  I had with my 2 best friends (they are very succesful developers in the blockchain world) they make me realice that there is world of oportunities out there, which are achivable for anyone who is dedicated enought, because they dit it!.  I have been thinking about this long time ago, WHAT IF I BECAME A DEVOLPER ?, but is was until that meeting that something changed. It's a bit scary all the information I have to learn  and even thou I can talk, learn, speake and ask for their advice, It would be me alone who must acquire all this new skills<br><br>
      
      This was not a random chooise I took by chance. I have meditated enought, worked it with my mental coach, searched for self-taught developers testimonys and more. I saved some money for daily expenses and mentorship for a couple of months. Also, I do not have any major responsabilitys. And last but not less important, Im supported by my family and friends<br><br>  
      
      An enormoues plus to began this jouney Is that as a developer I have the oppotunity to CREATE or IMPROVE something, CONTRIBUTE to a community. Work with my friends and make new ones, becaise thats what happened to my friends. Also, I beleive  I can do it for anyplace in the world ..THATS AMAZING!!!<br><br>

      I think anyone should always find a sense on what they are doing, Does it moves me ?, Does it goes along with my person ?.<br> Just asking this is not enought, But it is something... I mentioned before that learning something new, is scary, sometimes overwhelming, mainly because  I have to make big changes in my process of learning, build a brain capable on demands of new skills and more...<br>
      So here I am wondering if all the time I will spent, lefting aside my career in poker, will have a succesful ending ??? ...It is pretty scary but I hope that looking back,it would be one os the best decisiones I ever made, just like the one I took when I decided to pursue poker professionaly
      Ofcourse it is impossible to connect the dots right now...I can't connect the dots looking forward, I can only connect them by looking backwards, but as I'm writting this I trust in something, because beleiving the dots will connect down the road will give me the confindence to follow my gut

      <h3>Blog Process</h3>
        <p>The Backgrounds I used are img I took from the internet which I really like. 
        Also in one Post I wrote about how I was introduced to  poker as a  career. I enjoyed very much writting every Post, what that one has a special meaning<br><br>
        This blog is pure HTML and CSS. My sources of Studying were Brad Traversy in Udemy, Some frontendmasters free courses and bootcamp.<br> 

        About the code I decided to leave almost every line that I commented because that showed me how much chancges I did, all the borders I used.. to help me understand were the elements were and more.<br><br>

        I really enjor doing this Proyect and writting down significant thing about myself, my future as a developer and  mi ideas<br>

        Last but not least, My developer name would be MATIX or Matix-Design. It is a concat between my name and the movie MATRIX, which I find one of the best of all times. Besides, I love the actor Kenau Reeves
